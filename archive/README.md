# Archived files

The following files and folders were moved to `archive/` to keep the repository root focused and human-friendly.

- `CHECKLIST.md` (verification checklist)
- `FIXES.md` (detailed fix notes)
- `SUMMARY.md` (fix report summary)
- `dumper.py` (development utility — archived)
- `lab-portal/placeholder.txt` (placeholder content)
- `jiva-health/` (empty directory archived as a placeholder)

Why archived
- These files are documentation, notes, or development utilities that are not required for day-to-day development or running the app. They are kept for historical reference.

Restore
- To restore any file, move it back to the repository root. Example:

```powershell
git mv archive/CHECKLIST.md CHECKLIST.md
git commit -m "restore CHECKLIST.md from archive"
```

If you prefer I can restore or permanently remove any item — tell me which one.
